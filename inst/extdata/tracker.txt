Hi {{author}},

Package Version: {{package}}
has been added to the repository.

Next Steps:

You should have received an email from me with your SVN credentials, Please
ensure the following
a) that you have read/write access to your package
b) please check the build report  for your package at [1] and get rid of all
warning/errors to get a clear build report.

A note about the build system:
Everyday at around 5pm PST, the build system takes a snapshot of all the
packages inside Bioconductor and then the next day after 12 noon PST, [1] is
created containing the output of R CMD build and check on all platforms. When
reading [1], please pay attention to the date displayed next to - "Snapshot
Date:"  and "This page was generated on".

Thanks,
