Hi {{author}},

{{tarball}} has been added to the Bioconductor repository and nightly
build system.

Next Steps:

You have or will in the next 48 hours receive an email from me with
your SVN credentials, as well as additional instructions. Please
ensure that you have read / write access to your package.

Your package will be built during the next nightly build
cycle. {{when}} at around 5pm PST, the build system takes a snapshot
of all the packages inside Bioconductor. The next day after 2pm PST, a
build report located at [1] is created containing the output of R CMD
build and check on all platforms. The build report for your package
will appear at [2]. When reading [1] and [2], please pay attention to
the date displayed next to - "Snapshot Date:" and "This page was
generated on" to verify what date the report is targeting.

Thanks,
