Hi {{authorName}},

The {{packageName}} package has been added to the Bioconductor repository. Some
helpful notes to help you as a package maintainer:

a) SVN Information
Your Subversion account information is the same as before, but
permissions have now been extended to your new package
You now have read/write access to the {{packageName}} package:
URL: https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/{{packageName}}
Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with your SVN
access.
SVN docs at: http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/source-control/

b) Build Report:
Your package's build reports are accessible at:
http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/{{biocVersion}}/bioc-LATEST/{{packageName}}/
Please keep an eye on the daily build/check reports and fix any Warnings or
Errors that occur.

c) RSS Feeds:
You can find the RSS feed for your software packages at:
http://bioconductor.org/rss/build/packages/{{packageName}}.rss

d) Stay connected using Bioc-devel mailing list and support site
http://bioconductor.org/help/support/#bioc-devel

e) Bioconductor Git mirrors
If you prefer to use Git and GitHub instead of Subversion, you can
use the Bioconductor Git mirrors which are documented at:
http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git-mirror/

f) Add Maintainer or Removal of Package from Bioconductor:
Please email us at packages@bioconductor.org with your requests
for new maintainers, please clearly state their name and email address
and CC them on the request email sent to us.

g) Permanent URL of your package.
Your package has a permanent URL:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/{{packageName}}/

This will redirect to the release landing page of your package
(and until it's released, the devel landing page). Therefore this
is the URL that should be used (in publications, etc.) to refer
to your package. For convenience, you can also refer specifically to
the devel version, the release version, or a specific numbered
version of Bioconductor:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/{{packageName}}/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/{{packageName}}/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/{{biocVersion}}/{{packageName}}/

Thanks for contributing to the Bioconductor project!
