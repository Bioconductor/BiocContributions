Hi {{authorName}},

Congrats on the {{packageName}} package being accepted to Bioconductor!  The
following information is to help you in your new role as a package maintainer.

Every package in Bioconductor gets its own landing page. Contents from your
DESCRIPTION file are pulled out to populate this page. Your package's
permanent URL is:  http://bioconductor.org/packages/{{packageName}}/

This will redirect to the release landing page of your package (and
until it's released, the devel landing page). Therefore this is the
URL that should be used (in publications, etc.) to refer to your package.
For convenience, you can also refer specifically to the devel version,
the release version, or a specific numbered version of Bioconductor:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/{{packageName}}/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/{{packageName}}/
http://bioconductor.org/packages/{{biocVersion}}/{{packageName}}/

Maintaining your package:

1) Bioconductor Branches - Release and Devel

Bioconductor has two versions of EACH package - release and devel.

Release - http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/{{packageName}}.html

The release branch is the stable branch of your package which is
constant - Every 6 months during the Bioconductor release,
whatever is in your devel becomes the release branch. Currently
since your package has not gone through a release cycle, you do
not have a release branch.

Devel - http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/{{packageName}}.html

Your package has been added to the devel branch. All changes that you need to
make will be done to the devel branch.
During the next Biocondctor Release, http://bioconductor.org/developers/release-schedule/
whatever is in your devel branch will be added to the release and only then
you will have two versions of your package.

2) Updating your package in Bioconductor:
You will need to use subversion to update your package inside Bioconductor.
SVN GUIDE: http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/source-control/

Your subversion account credentials are as follows.

Subversion user ID: {{userId}}
Password: {{password}}

These credentials give you read access to the whole Bioconductor
repository and WRITE permissions only to your package.

To update your package in the devel branch, you need to do the following steps:
a) Install subversion(svn) on your machine, if it is not already installed.
b) svn co --username {{userId}} --password {{password}} https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/{{packageName}}
To checkout your packages files from the Bioconductor subversion repository.
c) Make the necessary changes to your package.
d) Bump the version from x.y.z to x.y.(z+1) in your package's DESCRIPTION file.
   If the version is not properly changed your changes will not be pushed to the
   public repository.
e) R CMD build {{packageName}}
f) R CMD check {{packageName}}_x.y.(z+1).tar.gz
g) Fix any Warnings or Errors from step (e) and (f)
h) svn ci {{packageName}}
g) Check the build report next day (see point 3 for details)
Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with your SVN access.

3) Build report:
As stated in 1), all changes are made to devel branch of your package.
When you make a change to the devel branch of your package, please remember
to bump the version of your package in the DESCRIPTION FILE.
Everyday at around 5pm PST, the build system takes a snapshot of all the
packages inside Bioconductor and then the next day after 12 noon PST,
http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/ is created containing the
output of R CMD build and check on all platforms for each package.
Your package's build reports are accessible at:
http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/{{biocVersion}}/bioc-LATEST/{{packageName}}/

When reading the above, please pay attention to the date displayed
next to - “Snapshot Date:” and “This page was generated on”.
Please  keep an eye on the build/check daily reports for the Bioconductor
devel packages:  http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/ and get rid of any
warnings or errors from your packages build report.

4) RSS feeds:
You can find the RSS feed for software packages at:
http://bioconductor.org/rss/build/packages/{{packageName}}.rss

5) Bioc-devel mailing list
The Bioc-devel mailing list is used for communication between developers and
for important announcements like release schedules, build system news, etc...
Please check emails from the list as they are our primary communication method
to package developers.

Also, after your package has passed the build report's CHECK test for the first
time, we strongly encourage you to send a note to Bioc-devel to announce its
public availability (with a short description) so other people can start to
test it.

6) Adding Maintainers for your package:
If for some reason, your email address changes, please update the
maintainer field in your DESCRIPTION file. We may need to reach you
if there are issues building your package (this could happen as a
result of changes to R or to packages you depend on). If we are unable to
contact you for a period of time, we may be forced to remove your package from
Bioconductor.

If you want to add a new maintainer or transfer responsibility to
someone else,  please email us at packages@bioconductor.org
and clearly state the new maintainers name, email address and CC them on the
email.

7) Support Site:
Please respond to bug reports promptly at https://support.bioconductor.org/
We recommend that you 'follow' tags that match your own package (such
as your package name) so that you will be notified when someone is
asking a question that pertains to your work.

8) Removal of your package:
If you no longer want to maintain your package, please let us know and we will
remove it from Bioconductor, or (with your permission) find a new maintainer
for it. See: http://bioconductor.org/developers/package-end-of-life/
